## R Markdown

This is one of the R Markdown documents for Hanzhi's code portfolio from Week 7 to 12. 

Week 9

Random sampling


```{r }
sample(1:1000, 10)
set.seed(332)

## applying Sample function in R to mt cars table to extract 5 sample rows
set.seed(123)
index<-sample(1:nrow(mtcars), 5)
mtcars[index,]

```

Chapter 7 Plotting Systems

```{r airquality}
#Plot using the basic plotting system in R, with plot() and lines()
data(airquality)
with(airquality, {plot(Temp, Ozone)+lines(loess.smooth(Temp, Ozone))})

# Plot another scatter plot with codes:
data(cars)
 with(cars, plot(speed, dist))
title("Speed vs. Stopping distance")

# Plot with the lattice system
#Lattice plots is most useful for looking at milti dimensional data
library(lattice)
state <- data.frame(state.x77, region = state.region)
xyplot(Life.Exp ~ Income | region, data = state, layout = c(4, 1))

# I have covered ggplot2 in week 7 so skipping the rest part about ggplot2 in chapter 7

```


Chapter 8 Graphics Devices

```{r datasets, echo=FALSE}
# plot and make it appear on screen with a title
with(faithful, plot(eruptions, waiting)) 
title(main = "Old Faithful Geyser data")

# How to plot and save it in a pdf file -- a most commonly used yet basic approach
pdf(file = "myplot.pdf")  
with(faithful, plot(eruptions, waiting))  
title(main = "Old Faithful Geyser data")  
dev.off()  

library(datasets)

## Create plot on screen device and copy it to a png file

with(faithful, plot(eruptions, waiting))  
title(main = "Old Faithful Geyser data")  
dev.copy(png, file = "geyserplot.png")  
dev.off()

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
