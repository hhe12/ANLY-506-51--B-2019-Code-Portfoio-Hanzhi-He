INTRO:
This is my code portfolio for Exploratory Data Analytics course at Harrisburg University. During the course I have learnt how to use R to tackle raw datasets and conduct analysis. Moreover, I have learnt how to perfrom Exploratory Data Analytics, which will be a foundation to all the future data analysis I will conduct.

I have not only practiced codes from data imports, wrangling, descriptive analysis, and plotting basic visualization, but also learnt how to do clustering using K-means method. Plus, I've learnt how to do Principal component analysis. The coding experience and knowledge I gained from this course will support me in my future study at HU and my future career as a business professional. I am glad that I have chosen the course taught by Dr. Scrivner.

The code portfolio includes my work performed with instructions from following textbooks:
1. Peng (Exploratory Data Analysis), 
2. Gromund (R for Data Science),
3. and Phillips (Yarr. The pirate Guide to R)

My portfolio contains following items:
1. Week 2 Codes.R
2. Week 3 Codes.R
3. Week 4 Codes.R
4. Week 5 Codes (Tidy Data).R
5. Week 5 Rmarkdown.Rmd
6. Week 7 Codes.Rmd
7. Week 9 Codes.Rmd
8. Week 10 Codes.Rmd
9. Week 11 Codes.Rmd

Thanks for reading.
